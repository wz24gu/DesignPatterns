Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

An Abstract factory pattern is one level of abstraction higher than a factory method pattern.
It returns the appropriate factory classes, which will later on return one of the product subclasses.
