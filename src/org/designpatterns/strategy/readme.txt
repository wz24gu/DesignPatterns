The Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
